BUILT-INS                                       *afterimage-built-ins*

PNGs and GIFs are converted to/from XPM with ImageMagick.  XPM is a plain text
format that resembles a C header.  GUI versions of Vim will actually syntax
highlight the image data to resemble the original.  While no replacement for a
real image editor, this built-in can and has been used to tweak small icons.

PDFs are uncompressed/recompressed with pdftk.  Even when decompressed, PDFs
are partially a binary format, so this is mostly a novelty.

Word documents have their text extracted (one way) with antiword.

OS X binary plists are converted to/from XML with plutil.

CUSTOMIZATION                                   *afterimage-customization*

The easiest way to provide custom handlers is to learn from the source to the
built-ins.  Briefly:

AfterimageReadPost() should be called from a BufReadPost,FileReadPost autocmd,
with the argument being a string containing the command to run.  The source
and destination files should each be replaced by %s and must appear in that
order.  If this function returns true, that means that an entire file was
successfully converted, and that it is appropriate to issue commands like "set
readonly" or "setf myfiletype".

AfterimageWriteCmd() should be called from a BufWriteCmd,FileWriteCmd autocmd.
The argument is a command in the same format AfterimageReadPost() requires.

Don't forget to setlocal binary in a BufReadPre,FileReadPre autocmd if the
file is in fact binary.

If you have a customization you think others could use, feel free to submit it
to the author of this plugin.
